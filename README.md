# Walkit

I like to take random walks through Reddit whenever I get bored. Unfortunately, it takes a long time to do that because Reddit's random button feels really slow to me, and on top of that I see a lot of the same subreddits with no concept of progression throughout the subreddits.

# Goals

All goals are tied to a KPI (key performance indicator). Walkit attempts to meet the following goals:

* Allow random walks through subreddits, but have the time-to-click and MTTR be < 1 second.
  * KPI: MTTR from click to result is < 1 second
* Find subreddits that the user is interested in.
  * KPI: At least 1 subreddit is "found" interesting or novel to the user per session.
* Search for subreddits should work, and it should work for names and descriptions of subreddits.
  * KPI: Searching in-text should return results where the search string is matched against name and description of subreddits.
